The project was a great chance for learning and professional development and 
I could not have done it without help from several people. I first and 
foremost want to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Dmitrii Pasechnik, for his excellent guidance throughout the project.  
I also want to thank Nathann Cohen and the open-source community 
of Sage for their input as well. At last, I want to thank 
for the great support I received from many selfless employees 
here at University of Oxford. Without their support, my project would not have been possible.
